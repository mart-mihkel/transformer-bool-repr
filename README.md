Run `make sync` to setup a local environment, see [Makefile](./Makefile) for other dev commands.

The cli has scripts for training models on various boolean functions, see `uv run cli.py --help` for details.

## Notebooks

Notebooks contain visualizations of results, run `make marimo` to run the notebook server.
